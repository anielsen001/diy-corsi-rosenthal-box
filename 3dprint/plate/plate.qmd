Rather than woodworking, a 3D printed plate can be used as well. This design is based on a 3D-printed [customizable fan grill cover](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2802474). This [thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/) posted project contains OpenSCAD code to create a wide variety of fan covers. Several modifications have adapted it to a CR-box:

- Increased the plate size to have overlap for fitting to MERV 13 filters but an extra border of 25 mm. 
- Removed rounded corners so that plates fit together more tightly. 

These modifications can be found [here](customizable_fan_cover.scad).
