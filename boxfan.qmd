title: CR Box Fan
format: html

This is the first box, built around December 2021 and rebuilt in September 2022 with new filters. @fig-new-used-compare shows the difference between a new and used filter. 

This original box was largely used in an open basement. The box fan is a 20in. Hurricane which works well becuase the control is accessible, but it is louder than I'd like. The fitlers are 3M Filtrete 1900.
