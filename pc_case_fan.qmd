## Background

Joey Fox at [https://itsairborne.com/](https://itsairborne.com/) has a good [guide to build a PC Case Fan version of the CR Box](https://itsairborne.com/building-a-pc-fan-corsi-rosenthal-box-68e7cd1ca570). Which is what I followed to build mine:

## Power draw

At full power, draws 11-12 Watts.
