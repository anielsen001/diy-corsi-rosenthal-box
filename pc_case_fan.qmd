## Background

Joey Fox at [https://itsairborne.com/](https://itsairborne.com/) has a good [guide to build a PC Case Fan version of the CR Box](https://itsairborne.com/building-a-pc-fan-corsi-rosenthal-box-68e7cd1ca570). Which is what I followed to build this one:

This design involves a bit of wood working, which is not my forte, so I came up with a similar version that used 3D printed plates.

## 3D printed plate version

Rather than woodworking, a 3D printed plate can be used as well. This design is based on a 3D-printed [customizable fan grill cover](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2802474). This [thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/) posted project contains OpenSCAD code to create a wide variety of fan covers. Several modifications have adapted it to a CR-box:

- Increased the plate size to have overlap for fitting to MERV 13 filters but an extra border of 12.2 mm. 
- Increased plate size border to 7.5 mm to fit within the 20in length of the filter and avoid interference when panels are next to each other. 
- Removed rounded corners so that plates fit together more tightly. 

These modifications can be found [here](/3dprint/plate/customizable_fan_cover.scad). Each panel is "welded" together using a soldering iron.

An additional improvement was to put some pre-filter material over the filters to catch animal hair.

## Air flow

- [From technical specs](https://www.arctic.de/us/P14-PWM/ACFAN00124A) each fan draws 72.8 CFM/ 123.8 m3/h

## Power draw

At full power, draws 11-12 Watts, as measured with a Kill-a-Watt.
