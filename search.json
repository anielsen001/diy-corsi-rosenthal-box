This thingiverse posted project contains OpenSCAD code to create a wide variety of fan covers. Several modifications have adapted it to a CR-box:\n\nIncreased the plate size to have overlap for fitting to MERV 13 filters but an extra border of 12.2 mm.\nIncreased plate size border to 7.5 mm to fit within the 20in length of the filter and avoid interference when panels are next to each other.\nRemoved rounded corners so that plates fit together more tightly.\n\nThese modifications can be found here."
