    "text": "Rather than woodworking, a 3D printed plate can be used as well. This design is based on a 3D-printed customizable fan grill cover. This thingiverse posted project contains OpenSCAD code to create a wide variety of fan covers. Several modifications have adapted it to a CR-box:\n\nIncreased the plate size to have overlap for fitting to MERV 13 filters but an extra border of 25 mm.\nRemoved rounded corners so that plates fit together more tightly.\n\nThese modifications can be found here."
